# weathercast-NJE

A fairly basic weather forecast app created using the OpenWeather API ((https://openweathermap.org/api)) for weather information (and ipapi.com for location details.) This was produced as a project for the UCONN Coding Bootcamp, and it is not intended for private or commercial use beyond that purpose. 


## Possible Errors

Please note that the app is designed only to provide info on locations in the US. It WILL attempt to provide info for foreign locations as provided by the API, but success and accuracy are not guaranteed. "Multiple-name" locations (i.e. Hong Kong) will definitely not function properly.
